## Description

Create an application in which neighbors can contact each other when having problems that concern the neighbor community. Our objective is to make a welcoming community and to facilitate the explanation of problems within a building. To do that, we have worked with the Agile Methodology: `SCRUM` and `Trello`.  

The project was devided in 4 sprints:

* __Sprint 1__: Project Description and defining Non-/Functional Requirements of the system
* __Sprint 2__: Defining the Actors, use-case diagrams and specifications
* __Sprint 3__: Defining the class diagram and sequences diagrams
* __Sprint 4__: Defining the Test Cases (e.g., adding a meeting, user management and managing notifications)
